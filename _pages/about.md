Hi! Iâ€™m Zihan, a third-year Ph.D. student at [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu/), Seattle, advised by Prof. [Paul Kinahan](https://rad.uw.edu/people/kinahan) (IEEE Life Fellow, FAAPM, FSNMMI, FAIMBE). I received my Master degree from the [Department of Computer Science](https://cs.illinois.edu/), [UIUC](https://illinois.edu/) in 2023. 

My research focuses on the Multimodal Large Language Model including the vision-language model and medical image analysis. I am committed to helping doctors or researchers carry out quantitative analysis and treatment planning for tissues and organs of the human body by combining AI with medical images. I am currently a member of the [AAPM-MIDRC](https://www.aapm.org/org/structure/default.asp?committee_code=MIDRC) subcommittee and [MIDRC/CRP-12](https://www.midrc.org/midrc-collaborating-research-projects/project-one-crp12), dedicated to determining medical image data quality, provenance, and harmonization.

Open to future collaboration on Foundation Models including VLMs and Large-scale Data Harmonization, I'd be delighted to engage in further conversation.

<!--**Actively looking for 2024 Summer Internship, I'd be delighted to engage in further conversation if you are interested.**-->

My work and research
======
My current works focus on multimodal learning, including natural language and radiology reports. At the same time, I pay attention to the corner case datasets to alleviate AI Underrepresentation in the medical field. I have participated in multiple internships in both academia and industry. I have worked as a research intern at the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/), [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu/), and [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn/), as well as at [Siemens Healthineers](https://www.siemens-healthineers.com/), [Alibaba DAMO Academy](https://damo.alibaba.com/?lang=en) and [Shanghai AI Laboratory](https://www.shlab.org.cn/). I have worked closely with several respected professors including Prof. [Alan L. Yuille](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~ayuille/), Prof. [Pietro LiÃ²](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pl219/), Prof. [Dinggang Shen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=v6VYQC8AAAAJ&hl=EN), Prof. [Jie Tian](http://www.mitk.net.cn/tian/), Prof. [Yu Qiao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=gFtI-8QAAAAJ), Dr. [Ali Kamen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=j41ocikAAAAJ&hl=en) and Dr. [Le Lu](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~lelu/).

My background and history
======
I am pursuing my Ph.D. degree from [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu/) and I received Master Degree from [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC)](https://illinois.edu/) and received Bachelor Degree from [Xiamen University](https://en.xmu.edu.cn/main.htm).
