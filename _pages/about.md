Hi! I’m Zihan, an incoming Ph.D. student of [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu/) in Seattle. And I received the Master degree from the Department of Computer Science in the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). I am committed to helping doctors or researchers carry out quantitative analysis and treatment planning for internal tissues and organs of the human body by combining deep learning with medical images.
