Hi! Iâ€™m Zihan, a first-year Ph.D. student at [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu/), Seattle, advised by Prof. [Paul Kinahan](https://rad.washington.edu/radiology-personnel/kinahan/) (IEEE Life Fellow, FAAPM, FSNMMI, FAIMBE). And I received my Master degree from the [Department of Computer Science](https://cs.illinois.edu/), [UIUC](https://illinois.edu/) in 2023. 

My research focuses on Large Multimodal Model (LMM) including vision-language model, self-supervised learning, and medical image analysis. I am committed to helping doctors or researchers carry out quantitative analysis and treatment planning for tissues and organs of the human body by combining deep learning with medical images.

<!--**Actively looking for 2024 Summer Internship, I'd be delighted to engage in further conversation if you are interested.**-->

My work and research
======
My current works focus on the multimodal learning, including natural language and radiology reports. At the same time, I pay attention to the corner case datasets to alleviate AI for Underrepresentation in medical field. I have participated in multiple internships in both academia and industry. I have worked as a research intern at the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/), [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu/) and [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn/), as well as at [Alibaba DAMO Academy](https://damo.alibaba.com/?lang=en) and [Shanghai AI Laboratory](https://www.shlab.org.cn/). Several respected professors have guided my research, including Prof. [Alan L. Yuille](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~ayuille/), Prof. [Pietro LiÃ²](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pl219/), Prof. [Dinggang Shen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=v6VYQC8AAAAJ&hl=EN), Prof. [Jie Tian](http://www.mitk.net.cn/tian/), Prof. [Yu Qiao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=gFtI-8QAAAAJ), Dr. [Le Lu](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~lelu/), and I have collaborated with them on many works.

My background and history
======
I am pursuing my Ph.D. degree from [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu/) and I received my Master Degree from [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC)](https://illinois.edu/) and received Bachelor Degree from [Xiamen University](https://en.xmu.edu.cn/main.htm).
