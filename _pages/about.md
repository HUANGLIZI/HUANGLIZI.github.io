Hi! Iâ€™m Zihan, an incoming Ph.D. student at [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu/), Seattle, advised by Prof. [Paul Kinahan](https://rad.washington.edu/radiology-personnel/kinahan/) (FIEEE, FAAPM, FSNMMI, FAIMBE). And I received my Master degree from the [Department of Computer Science](https://cs.illinois.edu/), [UIUC](https://illinois.edu/) in 2023. 

My research focuses on computer vision, self-supervised learning, medical image analysis, and vision-language model. I am committed to helping doctors or researchers carry out quantitative analysis and treatment planning for tissues and organs of the human body by combining deep learning with medical images.

My work and research
======
My current works focus on the multimodal learning, including natural language and radiology reports. At the same time, I pay attention to the corner case datasets to alleviate AI for Underrepresentation in medical field. I have participated in multiple internships in both academia and industry. I have worked as a research intern at the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/) and [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu/), as well as at [Alibaba DAMO Academy](https://damo.alibaba.com/?lang=en) and [Shanghai AI Laboratory](https://www.shlab.org.cn/). Several respected professors have guided my research, including Prof. [Alan L. Yuille](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~ayuille/), Prof. [Pietro LiÃ²](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pl219/), Prof. [Dinggang Shen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=v6VYQC8AAAAJ&hl=EN), Prof. [Jie Tian](http://www.mitk.net.cn/tian/), Prof. [Yu Qiao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=gFtI-8QAAAAJ), Dr. [Le Lu](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~lelu/), and I have collaborated with them on many works.

My background and history
======
I am pursuing my Ph.D. degree from University of Washington and I received my Master Degree from University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) and received Bachelor Degree from Xiamen University.
