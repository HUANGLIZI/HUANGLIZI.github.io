Hi! I’m Zihan, a Master student from the Department of Computer Science in the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). I am committed to helping doctors or researchers carry out quantitative analysis and treatment planning for internal tissues and organs of the human body by combining deep learning with medical images.
